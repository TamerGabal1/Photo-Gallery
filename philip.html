        <h1>Landscape Album</h1>
        <p>The Landscape Album specifically portrays the scenery of Indonesia while also 
            capturing the history and lifestyle of different Indonesian regions. 
            More often than not we lack to consider the beauty of the places that aren't
            particularly known. Being born in Indonesia, these monuments are what I have seen throughout my 
            childhood and I hope you can see the beauty in my home, through my lens.
